Connecting to Relational Databases on Heroku with Java
======================================================

Applications on Heroku can use any back-end data storage system.  You can either use a data storage system provided as a Heroku add-on or do your own thing.  The data storage systems available as Heroku add-ons range from relational databases to NoSQL databases.  Some of the relational databases that are available on Heroku are the shared Postgres database service from Heroku, the enterprise-grade Postgres database service from Heroku, various MySQL third party add-on providers, and the Oracle RDMS available from Amazon RDS.  Every application you create is automatically provisioned a shared Postgres database.  But you can easily add any other database service via Heroku add-ons.
